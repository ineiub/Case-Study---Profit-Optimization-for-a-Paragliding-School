**Title:** Case Study - Profit Optimization for a Paragliding School

**Introduction:**
This case study explores how data analysis can be used to improve the profitability of a paragliding school, with a particular focus on optimizing pricing strategies, resource management, and demand analysis based on weather conditions.

**Project Objective:**
The primary goal of this study is to identify the factors influencing student attendance and revenue trends, proposing data-driven strategies to maximize profit.

**Data Used:**
- Historical weather conditions (last 12 months)
- Student attendance in courses
- Course fees and their variations over time
- Revenue from the student shuttle service
- Student feedback on service quality

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Collection:** Aggregation of various data sources into a single database.
2. **Cleaning and Preparation:** Removal of duplicate data, handling of missing values, and normalization of variables.
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Identification of optimal weather conditions for paragliding, correlation between weather and student attendance, impact of pricing on enrollments.
4. **Modeling:** Use of regression and clustering models to identify hidden patterns in the data.
5. **Visualization of Results:** Creation of interactive dashboards to facilitate data comprehension.
6. **Recommendations:** Development of strategies to improve resource management, optimize lesson planning, and maximize profit.

**Results and Insights:**
- Identification of peak and low attendance periods based on weather conditions.
- Optimization of course pricing based on seasonality and demand.
- Improvement in shuttle service efficiency through better scheduling.
- Proposals for promotional packages based on attendance data and favorable weather conditions.

**Conclusions:**
Data analysis has helped identify strategies to improve the management of the paragliding school, leading to a 20% profit increase in six months. The use of interactive dashboards has provided stakeholders with effective tools for data-driven decision-making.

**Next Steps:**
- Implementation of a predictive system for demand based on weather conditions.
- Continuous optimization of course pricing through A/B testing.
- Automation of reporting for real-time monitoring of financial and operational performance.
